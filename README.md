## Where is this repository for?

This repository is for my lessons from the minor Web Development from the HvA.

## What's the goal of this repository?

In this repository I've made a overview of art object from the Rijksmuseum. My goal of this repo is to learn JavaScript more and understand it a bit better.

## Usage

With this application you can look through some of the art objects Rijksmuseum has to offer. You can get more information about the pieces and make your own perspectives on it. (note: as of now the search function doesn't work).

## Datamodel

## Installation

Clone this repository to your own device:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ROEL2407/real-time-web-2122.git
```

Then, in the terminal do:

```console
npm install
```

This project uses Nodemon. Because of hosting problems you need to change the npm start script from "node" to "nodemon"

## Online version

If you don't want to download everything, there's an online version for you [here](https://galgje-thegame.herokuapp.com/).

## Grading

My efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). I will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test I will be consulted and will be given feedback on things my course think deficient and things my course think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Improvement |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
|            | _Project_ Your app is working and published on Heroku. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository. Included are a description of the data-lifecycle, real-time events and external data source used by your app.      |             |
|            | _Complexity_ Youâ€™ve implemented enough real-time functionality for us to test your comprehension of the subject. A lot of functionality is self-written. You are able to manipulate online examples live.                                                   |             |
|            | _Client-server interaction_ By interacting with the app, a user can influence the data model of the server in real time by directly modifying data OR by influencing API requests between server and source. The student has set up the data manipulations. |             |
|            | _Data management_ The server maintains a data model and each client is continuously updated with the correct data.                                                                                                                                          |             |
|            | _Multi-user support_ Multiple clients can connect to the server. Interaction works as expected and is not dependent on the number of clients. You can explain how your app approaches this.                                                                 |             |

## Commits

In this repo I will commit my work. To make this more visible for myself and others I've added little headers to the commit titles:

- Created = a file is created
- Updated = updated a file or piece of code
- Delete = deleted a file

## Resources

### Credits

- Our teachers at the minor Web Development.
- My fellow students who've helped me resolving some problems and learning me new types of tricks.
- Stackoverflow for giving me the answer that I could tweak or that helped me understand my problem in the code better.
